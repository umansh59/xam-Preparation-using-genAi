## 📝 Description

The MCQ Generator is a Python application that generates multiple-choice questions (MCQs) using the powerful Langchain library. It allows users to create customized MCQs based on input text, making it suitable for various subjects and complexity levels. The application provides a user-friendly interface built with Streamlit, enabling easy interaction and seamless MCQ generation.

## 🎯 Features

- 📂 File Upload: Users can upload PDF or text files containing the input text for MCQ generation.
- 🎛️ Customization: Specify the number of MCQs, subject, and complexity level of questions.
- 🧠 Intelligent Generation: Leverages the Langchain library and OpenAI API for advanced natural language processing.
- 📊 Review Generated MCQs: View the generated MCQs in a table format along with a review in the Streamlit app.
- 📝 Logging: Application events are logged for easy tracking and debugging.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher
- OpenAI API key

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/AkshaySatasiya/mcqgen.git
   cd mcqgen
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   

3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Set up the API key:
   - Obtain an API key from OpenAI.
   - Create a `.env` file in the project root directory.
   - Add the following line to the `.env` file:
     ```
     OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
     ```

## 🏃‍♂️ Usage

1. Run the Streamlit application:
   ```
   streamlit run StreamlitAPP.py
   ```

2. Access the application in your web browser at `http://localhost:8501`.

3. Upload a PDF or text file containing the input text for MCQ generation.

4. Specify the desired number of MCQs, subject, and complexity level.

5. Click the "Create MCQs" button to generate the MCQs.

6. Review the generated MCQs in the Streamlit app.
